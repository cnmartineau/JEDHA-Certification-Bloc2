# Bloc 2 - Analyse exploratoire, descriptive et inférentielle de données - Speed dating with Tinder

### Introduction

Tinder is an online dating and geosocial networking application launched in 2012. It is the world’s most popular application for meeting new people. The application is available in over 190 countries and 56 languages. It has been downloaded more than 530 million times and led to more than 75 billion matches. In 2023, Tinder had 10.9 million subscribers and 75 million monthly active users. 

Tinder matches users based on geographic proximity. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests. Tinder uses a "double opt-in" system where both users must like each other (match) before they can exchange messages.

### Problematic

In 2002, Tinder experienced a decrease in the number of matches.

The company would like to understand the unlerlying basis of this drop.

### Scope

To better understand this decline in matches, the Tinder marketing team decided to focus on the profile of potential users in order to identify the key features that influence matching.

They ran a speed dating experiment, split into 21 experimental speed dating events (waves) from 2002 to 2004. During the events, attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their dates, participants were asked if they would like to see the other persons again.

Participants would have to give Tinder extensive information about themselves, that could ultimately reflect on their dating profile on the application. Information was collected in several surveys before, during, and after the event. The dataset includes information on each speed date, as well as information on demographics, dating habits, lifestyle information, self-perception across key attributes, and beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate.
